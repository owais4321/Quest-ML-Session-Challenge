# Machine Learning Regression and Classification Challenge

## Challenge Overview
Welcome to the Machine Learning Regression and Classification Challenge! In this challenge, you will apply your knowledge of regression and classification to solve real-world problems using two datasets:

1. **Regression Task**: Predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its composition and age.
2. **Classification Task**: Predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical and demographic features.

## Challenge Tasks
1. **Regression Task:** Build a model to predict the compressive strength of concrete.
   - Use appropriate preprocessing techniques.
   - Apply different regression algorithms and evaluate performance.

2. **Classification Task:** Build a model to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.
   - Handle any data imbalances.
   - Apply feature engineering and model selection.
   - Evaluate performance using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, AUC-ROC).

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with:
  - Model development and evaluation
- Clearly document your approach, choices, and findings.
- Upload your notebook before the deadline.
- **Submit your notebook through the following Google Form:** [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfeyfhw3LBCToAaymB2kAXd7fp9aSezmdzd-dk2MfFFW4gG_w/viewform]

## How to Make Your Notebook Stand Out
- **Clear Explanations**: Write well-structured markdown cells explaining each step.
- **Model Comparisons**: Compare different models and justify your final choice.
- **Performance Metrics**: Include evaluation metrics and explain their relevance.
- **Neat Formatting**: Use headings, bullet points, and code comments for clarity.

## Prize
The best notebook will win! The winner will be selected based on:
- Accuracy and effectiveness of models
